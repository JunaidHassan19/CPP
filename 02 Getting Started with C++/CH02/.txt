Basic data types:

Integer Types: C++ provides several integer types, such as int for general integer values and char for text characters encoded as bytes.

Boolean Type: The bool type represents Boolean values (true or false), useful for conditional statements and controlling program flow.

Floating-Point Types: float and double are used for storing real numbers with decimal points, with double offering greater accuracy.

Pointers: Variables that store memory addresses, allowing direct manipulation of data structures.

Strings: Handled as arrays of characters or using the more flexible String class from the C++ standard library.
