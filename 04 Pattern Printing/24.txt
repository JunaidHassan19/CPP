Star Triangle Reverse Pattern

Problem Description:
Write a program to print a right-aligned inverted star triangle pattern.

Requirements:
- Print 4 rows of stars
- Each row should have increasing number of stars (1, 2, 3, 4)
- Stars should be right-aligned with spaces
- Each star should be separated by a space
- The pattern should form an inverted triangle shape

Input: Number of rows (n = 4)
Output: Right-aligned star triangle pattern

Example:
For n = 4:
      *     (6 spaces + 1 star)
    * *     (4 spaces + 2 stars)
  * * *     (2 spaces + 3 stars)
* * * *     (0 spaces + 4 stars)
