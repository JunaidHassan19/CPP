 * * * * * * * 

Pattern Details:
- Total rows: 4
- Each row has an odd number of stars (1, 3, 5, 7)
- Stars are separated by spaces
- Each row is center-aligned with appropriate leading spaces
- Row i has (2*i-1) stars and (4-i) leading spaces

Requirements:
- Write a program that takes the number of rows as input
- Print the star pyramid pattern as shown above
- Handle edge cases (rows <= 0)
- Use nested loops for efficient solution

Example Input: 4
Example Output: The pattern shown above

Difficulty: Beginner
