Write a C++ program that prints the following alphabet pattern:

A B C D
A B C D
A B C D
A B C D

The program should:
1. Ask the user to enter the number of rows and columns
2. Use nested loops to generate the pattern:
   - An outer loop to handle rows
   - An inner loop to handle columns and print letters (starting from 'A')
3. Print the pattern with spaces between letters as shown above
