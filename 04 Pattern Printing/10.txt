Write a C++ program that prints the following number triangle pattern:

1
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5 

The program should:
1. Ask the user to enter the number of rows
2. Use nested loops to generate the pattern:
   - An outer loop to handle rows
   - An inner loop to print stars in each row (the number of stars equals the row number)
3. Print the pattern as shown above
