Write a C++ program that prints the following number pattern:

1 1 1 1 
2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3 
4 4 4 4

The program should:
1. Ask the user to enter the number of rows and columns
2. Use nested loops to generate the pattern:
   - An outer loop to iterate through rows (where the row number is printed)
   - An inner loop to repeat the row number across columns
3. Print the pattern with spaces between numbers as shown above
