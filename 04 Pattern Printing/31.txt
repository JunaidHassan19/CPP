Star diamond pattern

Requirements:
- Take input n (number of rows for the upper half including middle)
- For n=4, the pattern should have 7 total rows
- Each star should be separated by a space
- Use proper spacing to center the diamond
- The pattern should be symmetric both horizontally and vertically

Example:
Input: n = 4
Output: 7 rows as shown above

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 20
- Use nested loops for implementation
- Consider the relationship between row number and number of stars
- Upper half: stars = 2*i - 1 (where i goes from 1 to n)
- Lower half: stars = 2*i - 1 (where i goes from n-1 to 1)
