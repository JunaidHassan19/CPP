Write a C++ program that prints a solid square pattern of asterisks.

The program should:
1. Ask the user to enter the size of the square (n)
2. Use nested loops to print the pattern:
   - An outer loop for rows (from 1 to n)
   - An inner loop for columns (from 1 to n)
3. Print an n√ón square of asterisks

Example:
Enter the size of the square: 4
****
****
****
****

This pattern is called a "solid square" because it fills the entire square area with asterisks.
