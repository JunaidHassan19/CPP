Write a C++ program that prints the following alphabet triangle pattern:

A 
A B 
A B C 
A B C D 
A B C D E

The program should:
1. Ask the user to enter the number of rows
2. Use nested loops to generate the pattern:
   - An outer loop to handle rows
   - An inner loop to print stars in each row (the number of stars equals the row number)
3. Print the pattern as shown above
