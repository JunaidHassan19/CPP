Write a C++ program that prints the following alphabet pattern:

A A A A
B B B B 
C C C C 
D D D D 
E E E E

The program should:
1. Ask the user to enter the number of rows and columns
2. Use nested loops to generate the pattern:
   - An outer loop to handle rows (where each row displays a letter starting from 'A')
   - An inner loop to repeat the same letter across columns
3. Print the pattern with spaces between letters as shown above
