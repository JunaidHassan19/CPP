Write a C++ program that prints the following number pattern:

1234
1234
1234
1234

The program should:
1. Ask the user to enter the number of rows and columns
2. Use nested loops to generate the pattern:
   - An outer loop to handle rows
   - An inner loop to handle columns and print the column number
3. Print the pattern as shown above
