Write a C++ program that prints the following inverted alphabet triangle pattern:

A B C D 
A B C 
A B 
A

The program should:
1. Ask the user to enter the number of rows
2. Use nested loops to generate the pattern:
   - An outer loop to handle rows (counting down)
   - An inner loop to print stars in each row (the number of stars decreases with each row)
3. Print the pattern with spaces between stars as shown above
