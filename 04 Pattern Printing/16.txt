Write a C++ program that prints the following inverted number triangle pattern:

5 
5 4 
5 4 3 
5 4 3 2 
5 4 3 2 1 

The program should:
1. Ask the user to enter the number of rows
2. Use nested loops to generate the pattern:
   - An outer loop to handle rows (counting down)
   - An inner loop to print stars in each row (the number of stars decreases with each row)
3. Print the pattern with spaces between stars as shown above
